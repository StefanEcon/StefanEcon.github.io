Hello, I am Yingrui Song from Washington University in Saint Louis. My main research interest are now in firm dynamics and structural change. Specifically, I am recently exploring how information friction and non-rational belief could result in misallocation and lead to TFP losses across the economy. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
